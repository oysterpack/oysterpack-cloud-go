// Actor represents an actor in the Actor Model. Actors are objects which encapsulate state and behavior, they communicate exclusively by exchanging messages.
//
// The actors model provide a high level abstraction for writing concurrent and distributed systems. This approach simplifies
// the burden imposed on engineers, such as explicit locks and concurrent access to shared state, as actors receive messages synchronously.
//
// Actors communicate via messages over channels.
// All messages must be capnp messages to support distributed messaging.
// Actors are defined by an actor path. The actor path must be unique within a local process.
